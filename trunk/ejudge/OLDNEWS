Version 1.4.0 (????????)
========================

End user interface changes
--------------------------

Master judge now may change team information on fly. For example, he may
add teams, ban teams, etc. `master' script has a special button to
enter into team dialog screen.

New configuration file <idmap> (its name is arbitrary). This file contains
mapping from team logins as registered to team logins for the first tour
and team logins for the second tour. The format of the file is as
follows:
<primary login>:<id>:<team name>:<login 1>:<room 1>:<login 2>:<room 2>
<Primary login> is the login given when team was registered. Primary login
is used in other database files (teamdb, passwd, etc).
<Id> is the team id (an integer number).
<Team name> is the name of the team (arbitrary string).
<Login 1> is the login name for the first tour.
<Room 1> is the room (auditorium) for the command for the first tour.
<Login 2> is the login name for the second tour.
<Room 2> is the room (auditorium) for the second tour.
This file is used by make-teamdb and make-teamdb-inet programs when they
convert teamdb-local and teamdb-inet into the ejudge's internal teamdb file.

New program `make-teamdb'.
This program converts team table from the format, used by our internet
registration programs into ejudge's teamdb. The format of the source
file is as follows:
<field1>;<field2>;...;<field 22>
The meaning of each field is as follows:
 [0]  Team login
 [1]  Team id
 [2]  Flags - combination of one of the following letters
   t - team participates in the training tour
   f - team participates in the final tour
   y - team registration is complete
   g - team is non-local
   s - team participates in the selection tour
 [3]  Team name
 [4]  Institution name (full)
 [5]  Institution name (short)
 [6]  Faculty (full)
 [7]  Faculty (short)
 [8]  Participant name 1
 [9]  Participant year 1
 [10] Participant name 2
 [11] Participant year 2
 [12] Participant name 3
 [13] Participant year 3
 [14] Reserve name
 [15] Reserve year
 [16] Advisor name
 [17] Advisor position
 [18] Coach name
 [19] Coach position
 [20] Email
 [21] Phone
 [22] Home page

New program `make-teamdb-inet'.
This program converts database of teams, registered for the
internet tour into the table in teamdb format for ejudge utility.
The format of the source file (teamdb-inet) is as follows:
<field1>;<field2>;...;<field 13>
 [0]  Team login
 [1]  Team id
 [2]  Flags (none used currently)
 [3]  Team name
 [4]  Participant 1
 [5]  Participant 2
 [6]  Participant 3
 [7]  E-mail
 [8]  Country
 [9]  Zip
 [10] City
 [11] Address
 [12] Recipient
 [13] Home page

New program `send-passwords'.
This program sends a notification letter, which contains team login
and password to all the teams, registered for Internet-tour.
The program must be started with 5 parameters, described below:
  <inetdb> - the file name of the internet tour participants
    database. This is also the source file for make-teamdb-inet utility.
  <teamdb> - the file name of the team database for ejudge system.
  <passwd> - the password database of the ejudge system.
  <template> - the file name with informational letter template.
    Inside the template the percent sign ('%') starts conversions
    specifier. The valid conversion specifiers are as follows:
      %m - email address
      %l - team login
      %p - team password (in plain form)
      %n - team name
  <sendprog> - the name of program, which sends mail. This program
    is called without parameters, and the text of the message
    is passed on the standard input.

New configuration parameters
----------------------------

'%' and ';' are recognized as comment characters. A comment starts
from any of the following: '#', '%', ';' and lasts till the
end of line. Note, that use of '#' for comments is dangerous, if
configuration files are processed by a C preprocessor.

Some configuration variables accept format specifiers (in printf-like
style).The syntax of format specifier is as follows:
%[<flags>][<width>][.<prec>]<specifier>
The flags are as follows:
  e - if format specification generates empty output, substitute it
      with '&nbsp;'
  u - do uppercase conversion on generated output;
  l - do lowercase conversion on generated output;
  r - right-align output;
  c - center output;
  0 - pad output with leading zeroes;
Width is a non-empty sequence of decimal digit, starting not from 0.
Its semantics is exacly the same, as for 'printf' format specifications.
Prec is a non-empty sequence of decimal digit, starting not from 0.
Its semantics corresponds to the precision semantics in printf
format specifications.
Valid specifiers are listed below.
  G - global parameters
    none defined yet
  P - problem parameters
    Pi - problem identifier (integer)
    Ps - problem short name (string)
    Pl - problem long name (string)
  L - language parameters
    none defined yet
  T - tester parameters
    Ti - tester identifier (integer)
    Tn - tester name (string)
    Tj - reference problem identifier (integer)
    Tp - reference problem short name (string)
    Ta - architecture (string)
    Tk - key (string)
  M - team parameters
    Mi - team id (integer)
    Mn - team name (string)
    Ml - team login (string)
    Mp - team password (plain text) (string)
    Ms - team password (scrambled) (string)

Configuration parameters, which accept format string are listed below.
  problem.test_dir (if inherited from abstract problem)
  problem.corr_dir (if inherited from abstract problem)
  tester.tester_dir (if inherited from abstract tester)
  tester.tmp_dir (if inherited from abstract tester)
  tester.work_dir (if inherited from abstract tester)
  tester.exe_dir (if inherited from abstract tester)
  tester.errorcode_file (if inherited from abstract tester)
  tester.error_file (if inherited from abstract tester)
  tester.check_cmd (if inherited from abstract tester)
  tester.prepare_cmd (if inherited from abstract tester)
  tester.start_cmd (if inherited from abstract tester)

Value might be missed. In this case "1" assumed.
For example, if the configuration file has just the line
abstract
it is the same, as line
abstract = 1

Possibility to "inherit" problem, tester languages.
Problem specification may be declared "abstract".
Such problem must specify short_name,
but must not specify long_name, id or super parameters.
Any problem may inherit such specification by referring to its short_name
in super parameter. Certain parameters of abstract problem are copied to
this problem, if it does not define them
itself. The list of parameters, which may be copied is as follows:
  enable_rep_view
  full_score
  test_score
  run_penalty
  use_stdin
  use_stdout
  time_limit
  test_score_list
  test_sfx
  corr_sfx
  test_dir (*)
  corr_dir (*)
  input_file
  output_file

New global: max_line_length. The parameter affects how `run' program
generates protocol file. Each line, read from file to be inserted
into the protocol file (an input file could be either program output, program
error stream, checker output), checked against this value. If the length
exceeds maximum, it is not printed, a short message is printed instead.

New global: max_file_length. The parameter affects how `run' program
generates protocol file. If the file to be insterted into the protocol file
is longer, than this limit, the file is not inserted, but a diagnostic
message is printed instead.

New global: team_info_url
If this parameter is defined, references to team information pages
are included into the generated contest standings. Team name, printed
in each row of the standings table will be a reference to
URL containing some extra information about team (for example, its
home page). This parameter may include format specifications, which are
processed.

New global: prob_info_url
If this parameter is defined, references to the problems are included
into the generated contest standings. Problem short name printed
in the standings table header will be a reference to (for example)
its text. This parameter may include format specifications, which
are processed.

New tester: use_corr
If this parameter is set to "1", `run' checks for files with extra
information for checker (so called "correct" files, since those files
may contain correct answers for tests). Previous behavour, where
correct files were only used if corr_sfx was specified, is no
longer supported.

New tester: no_core_dump
If this parameter is set to "1", core dump is explicitly disabled for
processes being tested. This is done by setting maximum size of core file to
0. The default value is not set, i. e. system process settings are used.
This parameter is only meaningful on systems, where core dumps are
possible.

New tester: kill_signal
The parameter sets the method, which is used to terminate a process being
tested in case of time-limit exceeding. For Unix systems, the method is
name of signal, which is sent to child process. For Unix systems, the
parameter may be either SIGTERM or SIGKILL. The default value is
SIGTERM. Use SIGKILL for testing programs, compiled for the native
system (Linux), since such processes may install their own signal
handlers and ignore SIGTERM.

New tester: max_stack_size
The parameter sets the maximum stack size for a process being tested.
This parameter
is only meaningful for checking programs compiled for the native system
(Linux or similar). If this parameter is set for programs executed under
emulators (for example, dosemu), this may only result in incorrect
operation. By some (unknown) reason, this option does not work on Linux.
Default value is not set, i. e. process default are used.

New tester: max_data_size
The parameter sets the maximum data size for a process being tested.
This parameter
is only meaningful for checking programs compiled for the native system
(Linux or similar). If this parameter is set for programs executed under
emulators (for example, dosemu), this may only result in incorrect
operation. By some (unknown) reason, this option does not work on Linux.
Default value is not set, i. e. process default are used.

New tester: max_vm_size
The parameter sets the maximum size of virtual memory available for
a process being tested. The size of virtual memory is the summ of
the program size, data (bss and heap) size, stack size. This parameter
is only meaningful for checking programs compiled for the native system
(Linux or similar). Default value is not set, i. e. process defaults are
used.

Protocol additions and changes
------------------------------

A number of commands has been added to the Server-Judge protocol
in order to support editing of teams. The commands are:
MTEAMS, JTEAMS, VTEAM, CHGLOGIN, CHGNAME, CHGBAN, CHGVIS, CHGPASSWD,
NEWTEAM. These new protocol commands support team administration
from `judge' and `master' CGI programs.

Other changes
-------------

CGI_DATA_PATH compilation parameter appeared in makefile. It allows
changing of the directory where the CGI programs (team, master) looks
for their configuration files. By default its value is "../cgi-data".
If CGI_DATA_PATH is relative (ie does not start with '/'),
the path to the CGI program itself is added. If CGI_DATA_PATH
is absolute, it is not changed.

Version 1.3.1 (20010502)
========================

Implemented support for `test_score_list' problem level parameter.
It allows to assign different scores to different tests. The syntax
is as follows (EBNF):

test_score_list_spec = "test_score_list" "=" "\"" score_list "\"" ;
score_list = score_item { score_item } ;
score_item = score
           | "[" index "]" score ;
score = INTEGER ;
index = INTEGER ;

- if `index' is used, it must be in range from 1 to number of tests for
  this problem (determined by the number of files in test directory);
- if `index' is not used, `score' is assigned to the test with number
  greater that the number of the previous test by 1, in this case
  there must be enough tests;
- if no `index' is used in the whole `score_list' specification and
  the number of scores defined is less than the number of tests for this
  problem, warning is issued;
- `score' must be greater than 0;
- summ of the scores for all the tests (counting implicit scores
  defined by `test_score' parameter, or 1 by default) must not
  exceed `full_score' for the problem.
