Version 1.3.1 (20010502)
========================

Implemented support for `test_score_list' problem level parameter.
It allows to assign different scores to different tests. The syntax
is as follows (EBNF):

test_score_list_spec = "test_score_list" "=" "\"" score_list "\"" ;
score_list = score_item { score_item } ;
score_item = score
           | "[" index "]" score ;
score = INTEGER ;
index = INTEGER ;

- if `index' is used, it must be in range from 1 to number of tests for
  this problem (determined by the number of files in test directory);
- if `index' is not used, `score' is assigned to the test with number
  greater that the number of the previous test by 1, in this case
  there must be enough tests;
- if no `index' is used in the whole `score_list' specification and
  the number of scores defined is less than the number of tests for this
  problem, warning is issued;
- `score' must be greater than 0;
- summ of the scores for all the tests (counting implicit scores
  defined by `test_score' parameter, or 1 by default) must not
  exceed `full_score' for the problem.
