	libdwarf.h
	dwarf.h
	and all the .h and .c files in this implementation of
	libdwarf are copyrighted according to the file
	LIBDWARFCOPYRIGHT (which mentions the LGPL version 2.1).   
        Each file mentions the LGPL.
        The full text of the LGPL 2.1 is provided in LGPL.txt

The libdwarf documentation:
	libdwarf2.1.mm
	is based on material submitted to the UI PLSIG as proposed
	interfaces for dwarf, but completely rewritten.  
        Copyright ownership is therefore SGI (but see the document for details)  
        and it seems clear that the intent was there was to be free
	copying with no fees.

        libdwarf2p.1.mm
        is documentation of a set of interfaces 
        (not part of the UI PLSIG proposals)
        and the document was written from scratch at SGI.
        Copyright ownership is therefore SGI (but see the document for details)  
        and it seems clear that the intent was there was to be free
	copying with no fees.
