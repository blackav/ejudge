/*  This  implements _dwarf_insert_harmless_error
    and related helper functions for recording
    compiler errors that need not make the input
    unusable.

    Applications can use dwarf_get_harmless_error_list to
    find (and possibly print) a warning about such errors.

    The initial error reported here is
    DW_DLE_DEBUG_FRAME_LENGTH_NOT_MULTIPLE which was a
    bug in a specific compiler.

    It is a fixed length circular list to constrain
    the space used for errors.

    The assumption is that these errors are exceedingly
    rare, and indicate a broken compiler (the one that
    produced the object getting the error(s)).

    dh_maxcount is recorded internally as 1 greater than
    requested.  Hiding the fact we always leave one
    slot unused (at least).   So a user request for
    N slots really gives the user N usable slots.  */
