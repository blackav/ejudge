To just build libdwarf and dwarfdump one might do:
    ./configure
    make dd
    #You may need to be root to do the following copy commands
    cp dwarfdump/dwarfdump      /usr/local/bin
    cp dwarfdump/dwarfdump.conf /usr/local/lib
    #The following is optional, not needed to run dwarfdump
    #when doing the default build.
    cp libdwarf/libdwarf.a      /usr/local/lib

For a simple build of libdwarf, dwarfdump, and dwarfdump2 
and the other tools:
    ./configure
    make
    cp dwarfdump2/dwarfdump <somewhere>
    #Optionally: cp libdwarf/libdwarf.a <somewhere>

To build all the tools (including dwarfgen and 
dwarfexample) use 'make all'. There are known 
small compile-time issues with building dwarfgen on 
MaxOSX and most don't need to build dwarfgen.
    ./configure
    make all

To also build a shared libdwarf in the process, do:
    ./configure --enable-shared
    make
    cp libdwarf/libdwarf.so <somewhere>
    cp dwarfdump2/dwarfdump <somewhere>

When ready to create a new distro,
do
./CPTOPUBLIC
./BLDLIBDWARF yyyymmdd
where that could be
	./BLDLIBDWARF 20140131
as an example.
