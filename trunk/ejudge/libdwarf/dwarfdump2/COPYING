David Anderson: December 2006
The code in the dwarfdump directory is (if you look
in each file) covered by the GPL (not the LGPL).  The
DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT file, though, said (before December 24,
2006) the copyright is LGPL.  There is no doubt in my (David
Anderson) mind that the intent was always that dwarfdump be
GPL and the copyright markings in each file are correct.

There are three files marked with the LGPL: tag_tree.list
tag_attr.list acconfig.h.  These markings are left as is and
these are are therefore LGPL files.

The DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT file now (Dec 24 2006) has both
copyrights and an explanation of where each applies.



-------------------------------------------
The text present for years, thru Dec 23, 2006:
The files:
	dwarfdump.c
	and all the .h and .c files in this implementation of
	dwarfdump are copyrighted according to the file
	DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT.
