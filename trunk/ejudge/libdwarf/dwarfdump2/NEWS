  Added new checking options.
  To get good relocation-handling dwarfdump now expects to read
  headers from libdwarf with the relocation numbers. That means
  building dwarfdump separate from the libdwarf source is no
  longer as useful as it was.  It is best to build libdwarf
  and dwarfdump together for decent handling of relocatable
  objects.

  Now prints missing line table column number as 0 (now
  matching the DWARF spec), the previous
  practice of printing -1 was always wrong.
  And prints the DWARF3/4 new line table fields (when present).

  Added support for printing .debug_types (type unit) data.
October 26, 2011
    Added new features to Makefile.in and documented in README
    how to build dwarfdump with headers or libraries in
    non-standard places.

    By default the various places with string option values
    and file paths all use URI transformation on input and
    if the transformation does anything at all dwarfdump reports
    the input and transformed strings.  This makes it easy
    to deal with strings and expressions and file paths
    that are difficult to express in a shell (or that getopt
    mangles). Options  -q and -U give you  control over this process.

    The -x abi=mips  frame register abi in dwarfdump.conf is now
    usable with modern MIPS objects as well as old IRIX objects.
    There are other mips-* frame register setups described
    in dwarfdump.conf for anyone testing that nothing new has
    been added that conflicts with old IRIX/MIPS frame generation.

    Revised in major ways to do the additional checks and produce the same
    output as dwarfdump.  But making use of C++ features.
March 29, 2011
    All indentations changed to a consistent 4 characters per level.
    This was a massive but simple change.
January 26, 2010
    Changed the default frame-data register names from MIPS to
    a generic set of registers.  
    Try  '-x abi=mips' to get the traditional old MIPS register
    naming.
June 22, 2009
    Added the -S option to dwarfdump.
June 10, 2009
    Moved the gennames.c code to libdwarf.
May 4, 2009
    Replaced awk source-generation of certain functions 
    with new gennames.c code.
April 04, 2009
    Now frame printing (-f and -F) uses a different interface
    to libdwarf which is far more efficient for the particular
    purpose of printing all the register rules.  Reduces
    MxN print time to M (one extreme case reduces from 2 hours
    to 2 minutes).
Feb 28, 2009
    Created this new source base in C++ (from dwarfdump, which
    is C).
