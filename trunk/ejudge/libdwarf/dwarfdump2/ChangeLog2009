2009-12-30  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.64.
2009-11-24  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * tag_common.h: Updated 'standard tag table row' and
        tag table column maximums now the DWARF4 entries are
        in the .list files. Removed dos 'CR' characters at line ends.
      * tag_tree.list, tag_attr.list: Added various
        DWARF4 entries and added DW_TAG_enumeration_type
        under DW_TAG_union_type.
2009-11-17  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.1: Document the -u option more fully.
      * print_die.cc: Check for both info_flag and
        cu_name_flag to decide when to print DIEs.
2009-10-12  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.cc: Updated dwarfdump version string to today.
2009-09-30  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.cc: Added globals for aranges checking and
        to print the resulting error count.
      * print_aranges.cc: Added checking that all 3 ways
        of computing a cu_die_offset from an arange get
        the same offset (checked with -r -ka).
      * print_frames.cc: DW_CFA_cfa_offset_extended_sf 
        corrected to DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf.
        The print_frames code now uses the dwarf_get_CFA_name() call
        from libdwarf to print frame operation names.
      * globals.h: New function SpaceSurround() so we can use
        dwarf_get_CFA_name concisely in print_frames.cc. 
        Added aranges_result
        and check_aranges so print_aranges.cc can use them.
2009-09-01  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * tag_tree.list:  We add
        DW_TAG_class_type as a valid child of a DW_TAG_union_type.
2009-08-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * gennames.c: Change include from getopt.h to unistd.h
        so the code is more universally compilable.
2009-06-23: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * strstrnocase.cc: Corrected typo in TEST code and
        added a new test.

        string comparison, strstrnocase.c.
      * stristr.c: deleted.
      * strstrnocase.c: New code, written by me so no
        license issues.
      * print_die.c: Call is_strstrnocase(),
        the new function.  Change a local variable to unsigned 
        to avoid a compiler warning about signed/unsigned comparison.
      * dwarfdump.1: More fully document -S.
      * globals.h: Create extern for is_strstrnocase().
2009-06-18: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * configure: Regenerated.
      * Makefile.in: Added stristr.o
      * dieholder.h,print_die.cc, dwarfdump.cc,print_lines.cc,print_aranges.cc: 
        Added support for -S

      * fderegs.h: Remove unused line and switch
        an argument to unsigned to avoid -Wall warning.
      * naming.cc,naming.h: New files that implement the
        ellipsis functionality of dwarfdump and defer to
        libdwarf to get the names of the TAGs, FORMs, etc..
      * gennames.cc: This file has moved to libdwarf, no longer
        present in dwarfdump.
      * print_static_vars.cc,print_static_funcs.cc,
        print_sections.cc,print_strings.cc, print_locs.cc,
        print_lines.cc, print_pubnames.cc,print_ranges.cc,
        print_macros.cc,print_types.cc,tag_common.cc,
        print_weaknames.cc, print_aranges.cc: Include
        changed from dwarf_names.h to naming.h
      * dwarfdump.cc:  Updated DWARFDUMP_VERSION string.
      * tag_tree.cc,tag_attr.cc: Include changed from 
        dwarf_names.h to naming.h.  Remove dbg argument to get_TAG_name.
      * print_die.cc,print_abbrevs.cc:  Include changed from 
        dwarf_names.h to naming.h.
        Calls to get_TAG_name (etc) no longer have a dbg argument.
      * Makefile.in: We no longer build generated file names.c,
        we build naming.c (hand coded, not generated).
      * tag_common.h: Delete table of TAG names, libdwarf provides
        the name strings now.
2009-05-10: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.cc: updated DWARF_VERSION string.
      * print_frames.cc: When using the older frame register
        interface with -v, suggest use of -R instead of erroring off
        or segfaulting in dwarfdump.
2009-05-07: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: The dwarf_names* files are all
        generated by C++ now, so clean cleans them out.
2009-05-04: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_names.awk, at_list.awk: deleted. gennames.cc replaces these.
      * common.h, common.cc: Extracted simple utility routines
        into their own files.
      * tag_common.c, tag_common.h: Removed the simple utility
        routines from these files to simplify dependencies.
      * tag_attr.cc, tag_tree.cc: Include new common.h.
      * print_frames.cc, print_frames.h: Adding address_size argument to call.
      * print_locs.cc: Gets and uses CU-specific address_size.
      * print_ranges.cc: Adding commentary.
      * print_die.cc: adding DIE argument to ensure correct
        address size used for the CU in question.
      * Makefile.in: Now handles common.* and gennames.cc changes.
      * gennames.cc: New code emitting string 'get name' source.
      * print_frames.h: Adding new address_size argument to 
        get_string_from_locs().
      * dwarf_names_new.h: Deleted from svn, this is generated.
2009-04-03: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: clean up 'clean' and 'distclean'
        so that distributed files are not cleaned out by 'clean' 
        and all generated files (even those shipped in distribution)
        are cleaned out by distclean.
      * fderegs.h: New class that reads interface 2  and 3 libdwarf
        and reduces to a common interface to simplify print_frames.cc
        It also radically speeds up frame printing when there are
        large numbers of registers in the ABI by using a different
        libdwarf interface than before.
      * print_frames.cc: Uses FdeRegs class to simplify and unify
        getting frame registers. Uses a different libdwarf interface
        to speed up register acquisition.
      * dwarfdump.cc: Added calls to libdwarf to specify the correct
        'same value' and 'undefined value' pseudo-register numbers.
      * dwarfdump.1: Amplified -R and -x abi= documentation.
      * dwconf.cc: Added comments and deleted a few duplicated lines.
      * dwarfdump.conf: Added generic500 generic100 abis.
        Now all ABIs have same_val_reg: and undefined_val_reg:
        defined.
      * dwarf_names_enum.h: delete dwarf_names_enum.h from svn, 
        it is a generated file.
2009-03-29: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: References dieholder.h and srcfilesholder.h.
      * dieholder.h: New: Implements DieHolder class.
      * srcfilesholder.h: New: Implements SrcfilesHolder class.
      * print_aranges.cc: Use SrcfilesHolder and DieHolder classes.
      * print_sections.cc:  The dwarf_names_print_on_error flag
        is now a bool.
      * globals.h: Some interfaces use SrcfilesHolder and DieHolder classes.
        Some values now external so they are visible (used in print_infos()
        which is now in print_die.cc.
	The dwarf_names_print_on_error flag is now a bool.
      * print_lines.cc: Use SrcefilesHolder and DieHolder classes.
      * dwarfdump.cc: If should_skip_this_cu() we need to
        continue; and this fixes the omission of the continue.
        print_infos() moved out of here.
      * print_die.cc: Moved print_infos() to here. Interfaces use
        DieHolder and SrcfilesHolder classes now.
      * print_locs.cc: Add a new -v (verbose) output field so
        entries can be matched to .debug_info output.
      * dwarf_names.awk: The 'print on error' arg is now a bool.
        Removed a superfluous space from the generated code.
      * print_macros.cc: A ) was missing from the output.
      * tag_tree.cc,tag_attr.cc: The 'print on error' argument
        of the generated code (and all uses) is now a bool.
2009-02-28: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Created a new source base based on dwarfdump.
