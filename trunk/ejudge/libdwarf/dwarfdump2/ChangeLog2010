      * dwarfdump.cc: Now -a no longer implies -c because
        the -c option is not guaranteed to work by the DWARF spec,
        nor is -c really necessary.
      * README: More tweaks on the 'install' issue.
2010-09-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * README, Makefile.in: Amplified make install instructions.
2010-09-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.1: The -c option is not guaranteed to work.
        Because .debug_loc can have garbage bytes in areas
        not referenced by .debug_info.
2010-04-22  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.cc: If a location form is wrong report
        an error but continue operating.
      * dwarfdump.cc: Implement print_error_and_continue().
        Fix typos in usage message.
      * globals.h: Declare print_error_and_continue().
2010-04-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.cc,print_lines.cc: Ensure that
        the error checks counts are as accurate as possible.
        New version date.
      * print_frames.cc: Ensure that
        the error checks counts are as accurate as possible.
        Modify a message about fdes to get the strings to match 
        print_frames.c dwarfdump.
2010-03-31  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.1: Added some text about 'harmless'
        errors.
      * dwarfdump.c: Change the harmless error list maximum
        to 50. Change harmless error reporting to be associated
        with -k flags.
      * print_frames.cc: Change harmless error reporting to be 
        associated with -k flags.
      * print_aranges.cc: Call dwarf_get_arange_info_b allowing
        for segmented architectures which are really only
        defined properly in aranges for DWARF4.
        Change harmless error reporting to be
        associated with -k flags.
      * globals.h: Declarations added for 'harmless' error
        reporting.
2010-03-28  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_globals.h: Added interface to print_any_harmless_errors().
      * dwarfdump.cc: Added print_any_harmless_errors() implementation
        and we call it just before closing libdwarf.
      * print_frames.cc: Call print_any_harmless_errors after
        getting cie/fde list.
      * dwarfdump.conf: Add abi named 'arm' for Arm users.
2010-02-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.cc: Add newer DW_OP operators, remove
        bogus test of DW_OP_nop as the highest valid operator.
        Add table of DW_OPs to simplify testing for zero-operand
        operators.
        Revise so that the FORM of all attributes print with -M.
      * tag_attr.list: Updated copyright.
      * tag_tree_ext.list, tag_attr_ext.list: Added GNU template 
        parameter tags, attributes. Updated copyright.
      * tag_tree.list: Added template parameter tags. Added
        entry for nested classes. Updated copyright.
      * tag_common.h: Increased STD_TAG_TABLE_COLUMNS and 
        EXT_ATTR_TABLE_COLS.
2010-01-30  DavidAnderson  <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c: Changed the spelling of one
        'DW_AT_type offset does not point to type info' error message so
        one can distinguish which check lead to the message.
2010-01-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwconf.cc, fderegs.h, dwconf.h, dwarfdump.1,
        dwarfdump.conf: The default frame values in frame
        output are now generic registers like r0 to r99
        instead of MIPS register names.  
        For the MIPS register names use '-x abi=mips'.
2010-01-17  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.cc: The special case DW_AT_SUN_func_offsets
        now prints identically in dwarfdump and dwarfdump2.
2010-01-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * tag_common.cc, common.cc, common.h: Remove <cr>
        line terminator characters and update copyright year. 
      * All other files: Update copyright year.
