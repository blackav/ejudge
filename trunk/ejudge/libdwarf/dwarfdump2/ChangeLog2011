2011-12-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_die.cc: Add support for newer DW_OP_GNU_* .
2011-12-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.cc, common.cc: Update version string.
     * tag_attr_ext.list, tag_common.h: New information on GNU
       attributes meant allowing a larger row count.
2011-12-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * tag_common.h: A new attr in the .list means increasing
       the column count.
2011-12-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_lines.c: Now prints no-column as 0 not -1.
       And prints the DWARF3/4 line table values when present.
     * tag_attr_ext.list: Add a GNU extension.
2011-10-30  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * configure.in: Removed a couple bogus lines which were
       reporting strange shell errors.
     * configure:  Regenerated.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Refine the error outputs so bogus reports
       do not print.  Refactor the debuginfo/types prints for
       better reporting of errors.
     * globals.h: Refactoring meant changing one prototype here,
       the print_infos() prototype.
     * print_die.cc: Refactor the debuginfo/types prints for
       better reporting of errors.  Remove an 'error' report
       about DW_DLE_REF_SIG8_NOT_HANDLED.  It's unclear
       what we might want to do here in future, but an error
       report is misleading.
2011-10-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.cc, common.cc: Update version strings.
2011-10-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.cc: Reset the CU hints at each new section.
       Set up reloc flags so debug_types gets relocated if necessary.
     * globals.h: Add DEBUG_TYPES for the .debug_types section.
       Add a type-unit signature pretty-printer function.
       Add DW_SECTION_REL_DEBUG_TYPES so debug_types can be relocated.
     * print_reloc.cc: Add entries so debug_types can get relocated.
     * print_die.cc: Now we handle both debug_info and debug_types
       sections.  Moved some CU header print operations to little
       helper functions to clarify the code. Refactored print_infos()
       to deal with debug_types and debug_info.
       Using the new libdwarf functions that allow debug_types.
     * print_lines.cc: Delete unused local variable and its setting code.
2011-10-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Makefile.in, README: Added Make settings of PREINCS POSTINCS
       PRELIBS, POSTLIBS to simplify building when libdwarf or libelf
       are not in the normal locations.   Documented usable ways to
       deal with unusual situations at build time.
2011-10-24  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.cc: Update version string. 
     * dwarfdump.cc: Update version string. 
       To get '-c cu-name'  to work we need to set a local flag which is now set.
     * dwarfdump.1: Clearly identify the command line options where
       URI style input is expected.
     * dwarfdump.1: Clearly identify the command line options where
       URI style input is expected.
2011-10-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.1: Now input strings on command line use
       uri-style.
     * checkutil.cc: Fix indentation mistakes.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Now file names etc in input strings on command
       line use uri-style.

     * print_lines.cc: Fix indentation mistakes.
     * print_pubnames.cc: Fix indentation mistake.
     * uri.cc: Fix indentation mistakes. Change an argument to C++ string.
     * uri.h: Change an argument to use C++ string.
2011-10-22  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.cc :Update version string.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Update version string. Do not set ranges_flag
       with -a because that is unsafe to print seperately in general.
     * dwarfdump.1: Rewrite the man page for completeness and
       accuracy.
2011-10-11  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.cc: Update version strings.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Update version strings and use
       uri-to-standard transformation on -S options.
       Update version string.
     * uri.h, uri.cc: Define the transform_to_uri function.

2011-10-09  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.c, dwarfdump.c: Update version strings.
2011-10-09  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * checkutil.h: Fix bad indentation.
2011-10-09  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_strings.cc(print_strings): Add display_offsets
       test to make this like C dwarfdump (making offset printing
       optional). 
     * print_die.cc: Ensuring identical with C dwarfdump
       by checking for the display_offsets global in
       dwarfdump_print_one_locdesc(). And ensure that
       we have braces for if statements in get_location_list().
2011-10-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.cc: Removed an extra newline from a
       warning message so we match the dwarfdump version.
2011-10-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.cc:  Added a new argument to get_attr_value, so
       changed its calls here.
     * dwarfdump.conf: As for dwarfdump, changed the 'mips' abi
       to work well with modern MIPS targets.  For IRIX, 
       mips-irix and mips-irix2 abis are provided. 
     * dwconf.cc: Added a '.' at the tail of an error message
       to match dwarfdump.
     * globals.h: get_attr_value() has a 'verbose' argument now.
     * print_die.cc: Various calls now have a 'verbose' argument
       so critical uses can use a 'local' value when needed.
     * print_static_funcs.c: Changed an error message to make it
       clear this is the static funcs section, not pubnames.
2011-10-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.cc: Change ifdef to ifndef to match the dwarfdump
       version.
     * globals.h: Added comments giving the enum index values in
       a few places.
     * print_die.cc: For type_offset_result errors, give more
       complete error reports.
     * print_lines.cc: Ensure the if check and the CHECK_COUNT
       refer to the same error category.  Ensure we test for
       a checking flag before doing checking.
     * print_reloc.cc: Report the section name as .rela<something>
       when it is rela.  Ensure we don't index off the end of
       a scn_names array. Get the output line format to match dwarfdump.
2011-10-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.cc: Now Dwarf_Check_Result is in a vector, not an array.
       If harmless errors detected, a HARMLESS ERROR COUNT string is
       printed as a header.  Note that libdwarf treats relocation errors
       (for relocatable objects) as harmless errors whether they are harmless
       or not.  For sorting the compilers-detected, and equal counts,
       use the producer name to break the tie.  With -ka, no longer
       turn off check_frames_extended, it is already off unless the
       user explicitly asked for it.  Now the compiler-name reporting
       is identical to dwarfdump.
     * print_die.cc: Ensure newline and hex output details 
       match up with dwarfdump. Ensure we record program unit
       name when we need to (call tag_specific_checks_setup()).
       Added locations_result checks that were accidentally left out.
       Ensure newlines and hex outputs match dwarfdump.
       The decl_file_result checks were just wrong, but are now corrected.
     * print_frames.cc: Handle DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY specifically for
       dwarf_next_cu_header() call.  Get 'eh aug data' string details
       to exactly match dwarfdump.
     * print_locs.cc: Get index printing in location lists to match dwarfdump.
2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.cc: Use the dwarfdump usage text. Add remove_quotes_pair()
       for consistency with dwarfdump.c and use it. Add check_lines to -kF . 
     * print_die.cc: the have_a_search_match() test was backwards. Fixed.
     * print_lines.cc: Add record_line_error() so errors can be seen
       in detail when appropriate.  Add some CHECK_COUNT calls when appropriate.
2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_die.cc: Fix the formx code by removing recently-added use of llabs().
       Fix consistency issue in error strings versus dwarfdump.  Set record_dwarf_error
       flag false for consistency with dwarfdump. Ensure PU_name does not get
       FORM info for DW_AT_MIPS_linkage_name.
     * dwarfdump.cc:  Fix endl use for clarity. Add an endl in DWARF_CHECK_ERROR3 for
       consistency.
2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Makefile.in: Making naming.cc like dwarfdump means altering
       Makefile.in to be more like the dwarfdump Makefile.in
     * checkutil.c: Moved functions here (from the .h) for ease
       in debugging. 
     * checkutil.h: Moved a couple function definitions to the .h.
       Changed the VODtype member to be a pointer so it can be cleared
       out trivially, and altered uses to match.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Free regex data.  Make format details match dwarfdump.
       Make do_all() match dwarfdump version. Ensure suppress_check_dwarf()
       called in one more place. Get the -ka settings right.  For checking,
       lower verbosity to one.
     * globals.h: Insert get_proc_name() prototoype.
     * naming.cc: Add error checking (but only when used in dwarfdump itself).
     * print_abbrevs.cc,print_aranges.cc: Get formatting to match dwarfdump.
     * print_die.cc: Get formatting to match dwarfdump (which involved more
       than just format changes, had to ensure that the CU and PU globals
       are set too, for the error reporting).  Added the LinkOnce testing too.
     * print_frames.cc: Made get_proc_name a global function.  Fixed up
       formatting to match dwarfdump.
     * print_lines.cc,print_pubnames.cc,print_strings.cc: Fixed up formatting 
       to match dwarfdump.
     * print_types.cc: Made more like the dwarfdump version.
2011-09-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * check_util.cc: New FindLinkOnceEntry function added for completeness.
     * check_util.h: Added omitted LinkOnce and VistedOffsetData functions
       so the code is complete.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Expanded on the explanation of the -n option. get_cu_name()
       now uses the DieHolder class as its first argument.
     * globals.h: Corrected omissions and misspellings of a couple globals,
       and correct a couple function interfaces to use DieHolder.
     * print_abbrevs.cc: Added abbreviation validation code and unified
       a couple places to print like dwarfdump. 
     * print_aranges.cc: Major changes to add checking and organize like the
       dwarfdump version is organized.
     * print_die.cc: Major changes to organize like the dwarfdump version and
       add lots of checking.
     * print_frames.cc: Modest changes to get the output and checking to
       match the dwarfdump version.
     * print_lines.cc: Fairly modest changes to get the output and checking to
       match the dwarfdump version.
     * print_locs.cc: Small changes to get the output to match the dwarfdump
       version.
     * print_pubnames.cc: Perhaps 20% changed, making the printed output
       work like the dwarfdump version.
     * print_aranges.c: If not printing (ie, if checking) just return.

2011-09-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * checkutil.cc: Added a blank line for readability.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Added the reloc_map bit field to the print_relocinfo call.
     * globals.h: Added the reloc_map bit field argument to the print_relocinfo
       declaration.
     * print_reloc.cc: Updated so it handles rel and rela and
       uses the same format and code organization as C dwarfdump. 
     * print_sections.cc: Changed one error print format so it matches
       C dwarfdump hex output form.
2011-09-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in,common.cc,common.h,dwarfdump.cc,globals.h,
        print_abbrevs.cc,print_aranges.cc,print_die.cc,print_frames.cc,
        print_lines.cc,print_locs.cc,print_macros.cc,print_pubnames.cc,
        print_ranges.cc,print_static_funcs.cc,print_static_vars.cc,
        print_strings.cc,print_weaknames.cc,tag_attr.cc,tag_tree.cc:
        Pulled in dwarfdump.cc related code and headers from dwarfdump
        so at the dwarfdump level we agree with the C dwarfdump code
        with its new options and compiler-checking features.
        The output is not yet what we want for -k options, 
        but this is a start.

      * print_die.cc: Corrected handling of DW_AT_data_member_location.
        Corrected handling of 'class constant' function
        formxdata_print_value() so it does not leak memory.

      * print_lines.cc: Call translate_to_uri().
        Rearrange the order of the line flags and the filepath.
        Abbreviate the line flags.
2011-01-15  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_lines.cc: Alter line printing to a new format
        and with plain -l (no -v) print long pathnames in
        line output as <file path at pc 0xnnnnnnn> after
        the first occurance of a name.
