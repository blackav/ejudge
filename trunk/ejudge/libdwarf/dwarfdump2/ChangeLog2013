     * dwarfdump.cc: Now calls dwarf_register_printf_callback()
       so dwarf_print_lines() output is shown (if dwarfdump
       wants it shown). Update version string.
      * common.c: Update version string.
2013-08-11  David Anderson
     * print_die.c: Clarified a comment about DW_AT_high_pc and
       FORM class constant. 
       Fixed indent errors.
2013-08-07  David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.cc: Changed cerr to cout in all cases of
       errors other than fatal errors. Making it easier to
       understand where errors occurred when redirecting 
       the output.
       Updated version string.
     * common.cc: updated version string
     * print_reloc.cc (print_relocinfo_32): Removed a useless
       duplicated call to get_scndata.

     * dieholder.h: Corrected the indentation of DieVec.
2013-02-05  David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.cc, common.cc: Update version string.
       get_attr_value adds dieVec argument.
     * dieholder.h: Create new type DieVec for the die vector.
     * print_die.cc: Check DW_AT_sibling values for sanity,
       and when something quite wrong is found, print an error
       and stop. Uses DieVec now. Corrected some mistakes
       in handling the vector.
     * globals.h: Uses DieVec now, for print_one_die(),
       get_attr_value.
     * print_aranges.cc: Uses DieVec now.
     * print_lines.cc: Uses DieVec now.
     * globals.h: Uses DieVec now.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Uses DieVec now.

     * checkutil.h: A 64bit constant was missing the trailing ULL
       and a compiler caught the mistake. Added the ULL.
2013-02-01  David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.cc, common.cc: Update version string.
     * print_die.cc: One line had an indentation incorrect,
       as shown by dicheck. Fixed.

     * print_die.cc: Handle DW_OP_GNU_const_type using the
       binary compatibility version of Dwarf_Loc.
