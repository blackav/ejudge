/* print data in .debug_loc
   There is no guarantee this will work because we are assuming
   that all bytes are valid loclist data, that there are no
   odd padding or garbage bytes.  In normal use one gets
   into here via an offset from .debug_info, so it could be
   that bytes not referenced from .debug_info are garbage
   or even zero padding.  So this can fail (error off) as such bytes
   can lead dwarf_get_loclist_entry() astray.

   It is also broken because we do not know what CU is involved
   so if address_size varies by CU we cannot know that here.
