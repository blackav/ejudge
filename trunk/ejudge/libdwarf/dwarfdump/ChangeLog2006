     * DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT: Added GPL copyright text with
       explanation of the intended content.
     * COPYING: added text explaining confusion of GPL vs LGPL.
       Thanks to Chris Quenelle for pointing out the disconnect
       between DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT and the source files in dwarfdump.
2006-12-21 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>

     * print_frames.c: Clean up printing of augmentation data  by
       eliminating dangling 0x (for eh_frame).
2006-04-28 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * dwarfdump.conf: Now has x86_64 register names.
       x86_64 with help from Tom Hughes (verified
       from independent sources). 
       Added m68k register names and refined  x86 list
       by looking at various information-sources.
2006-04-18 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>

     * dwconf.h: Fix compiler warnings by changing types.
     * dwconf.c: Change error checking so we check all errors, do
       not stop at first error. Ran indent.  Added code to check
       for extra junk after operand(s).
     * print_frames.c: Fix compiler warnings.
     * Makefile.in: get <prefix> used in install rule and creating
       places to search for dwarfdump.conf
2006-04-16 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * dwarfdump.conf: New dwarfdump configuration file. Makes using frame
           information easy to read and correct for any ABI/ISA
           without rebuilding dwarfdump.
     * Makefile.in: Added new files dwconf.h dwconf.c
     * dwconf.h dwconf.c: New files implement reading dwarfdump.conf
       and help print_frames.c print frame information correctly
       for ABIs specified at runtime.
     * dwarfdump.1: document -x commands.
     * globals.h: Minor changes to support dwarfdump.conf
     * print_frames.c: Major changes to support a run-time description of 
       the frames info and dwarfdump.conf.
     * print_frames.h: Changes  to support a run-time description of 
       the frames info and dwarfdump.conf.

       print_frames.h print_frames.c.
     * print_frames.h print_frames.c: Extract cie, fde printing
       to separate file, separating loop logic from the printing
       of an entry from the loop.
2006-03-31 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * dwarfdump.c global.h print_sections.c: Preparing for 
       dwarf3 frame interface.
     * print_die.c: Corrects handling of DW_AT_encoding (etc) value.
2006-03-29 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * print_sections.c: define DWARFDUMP_TURN_OFF_MIPS_REG_NAMES 
       at compile time
       to turn off the MIPS register names printing.  Instead
       (aside from cfa) use a name like  r4 (where the DWARF 
       register number follows the letter 'r').
       Indent. Initialize some local variables at declarations.
2006-03-13 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * print_sections.c: Now gets gnu eh_augmentation data by calling
       dwarf_get_cie_augmentation_data() or dwarf_get_fde_augmentation_data()
       and prints it (use -v to see cie data).
       Now prints DWARF3 frame information.
2006-03-08 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * print_sections.c: Add 'break;' at line 710.
       Thanks to Richard Stuckey for noticing.
2005-12-01 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * dwarf_names.awk: use snprintf instead of sprintf for safety.
2005-12-01 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * Makefile.in: Build attr/tag trees with
       individual commands to catch build errors.

       tables fit in the generated C code and check for 
       format errors in the *.list files.
     * tag_attr.list, tag_tree.list: Added some valid entries. 
     * globals.h: add DWARF_ERROR3 macro for better diagnostics.

       in CHECK  -k diagnostic output.

2005-11-25 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * print_die.c: DW_AT_stride_size changed to DW_AT_bit_stride,
                    added DW_AT_byte_stride.
     * tag_attr.c,tag_tree.c: fixed array size now a #define for
	readability.
     * tag_attr.list: Added DWARF3  attributes, also new TAGs.
     * tag_tree.list: Added DWARF3 TAGs.

2005-11-08 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * makename.c: remove non-standard malloc.h include,
        stdlib.h suffices and is already included.

2005-10-24 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * tag_attr.c tag_tree.c: added DWARF3 TAGs to string array.

2005-08-01 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * Makefile.in: Add esb.o and test rule (test code for esb.c).
      * dwarfdump.c:  Remove old static buffer initialization.
      * print_die.c: Use esb now, avoid crash due to long loclist
        overrunning static buffer. Uses snprintf now, not sprintf.
        snprintf is for safety.
      * esb.h esb.c: Adding extensible string buffer (esb) code.
      * testesb.c: Test code for esb.c.
      * print_reloc.c: size field is now Elf64_Xword for 
        Elf64  as Elf64_Word is only 32 bits.

2005-07-15 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * dwarfdump.c: Add print of .debug_pubtypes, remove
        erroneous dealloc after dwarf_formstring() call.
      * globals.h: Add declarations for .debug_pubtypes print.  Add
        declaration for full dealloc.
      * print_die.c: Remove erroneous dealloc after dwarf_formstring() call.
      * print_exception_tables.c: Call dwarf_fde_cie_list_dealloc()
        for complete dealloc.
      * print_sections.c: Remove incorrect dealloc() call.
        Add calls to new dealloc routines. Add support of .debug_pubtypes
        print.
2005-07-14 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * print_sections.c (print_line_numbers_this_cu): Use new
        dwarf_srclines_dealloc() for deallocation after
        dwarf_srclines() called.

2005-04-13 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * print_sections.c: Factors out common print code into
        a new routine. Avoid indexing past end of register names
        array.  Adds checks and prints so that certain errors
        in pubnames-like sections are printed usefully (and dwarfdump
        then stops if libdwarf gave an error).
        
2005-03-21 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * dwarfdump.c: Add -F flag to
        request .eh_frame section print. Changed -f flag meaning
        to print .debug_frame only. -a flag no longer
	prints .debug_frame by default.
      * print_sections.c: avoid printing an eh_frame we don't understand.
	Add new information per CU when printing line info: specifically
        the line section offset.  
      * globals.h: Added arguments to print_frames() for -F flag.

2005-03-18 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * print_sections.c: Correct macro section printing.

2004-10-28 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT config.h defs.h dwarfdump.c globals.h
	makename.c makename.h print_die.c print_exception_tables.c 
	print_reloc.c print_sections.c tag_attr.c tag_attr.list
	tag_tree.c tag_tree.list: Copyright update, SGI
        corporate address change.

2004-10-26 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * acconfig.h: removed. Was old style autoconf usage.
      * configure.in: Updated AC_DEFINE usage, adding args 2 & 3.
      * config.guess: Updated. timestamp='2004-06-11'.
      * config.sub: Updated.  timestamp='2004-03-12'.
      * configure config.h.in: regenerated with autoconf 2.58.

2004-05-14 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>

      * print_die.c (print_die_and_children): Change to iteration
        on siblings (still recursing on children).

	
2004-03-30 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * dwarfdump.c (main): getopt() string should contain k:g
        not kg:    Thanks to Peter Seiderer for pointing this out.

2003-12-31 David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * README: Added configure example.
      * Makefile.in: Removed bogus LIBS line, updated copyright date.
      * acconfig.h: Added LGPL copyright to match libdwarf
	Silly, but it matches libdwarf version boilerplate.
      * config.guess config.sub: new versions from automake-1.6.
      * config.h.in configure: Regenerated.


2003-10-06   David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * dwarfdump.c print_sections.c: applied indent(1).
     * print_die.c: applied indent and added ; after
       invocations of macros PUSH_DIE_STACK POP_DIE_STACK SPACE
       as these were confusing indent a bit.
       The indent control file .indent.pro contained:
  	-bad -bap -nbbo -br -ce -brs
  	-l72  -lc72  -hnl  -nprs
  	-fca -i4  -lp -psl -npcs 
        


2003-10-02   David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
     * dwarfdump.c: Add -g to indicate use of older 
       location entry code in libdwarf.  So dwarf_loclist 
       and dwarf_loclist_n are testable.
     * globals.h: Added use_old_dwarf_loclist flag so one
       can choose the old dwarf_loclist() interface.
       For testing.
     * print_die.c: Rearranged to avoid code duplication.
       Now supports .debug_loc fully.
     * print_sections.c: Prints .debug_loc now.

2003-09-29   David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>

      * print_die.c: with -v, print 'loclist' start and
	end addr and also a hint that DW_FORM_indirect is used.
        No change for normal output (for now).

2003-05-19   David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * dwarfdump.c call dwarf_srcfiles() to get file names
        per cu and pass down to die print routines.
	Removed incorrect tests for when to print ".debug_info",
	leaving simpler test.
      * print_die.c globals.h: print file name (from line info)
	with DW_AT_decl_file, adding data from dwarf_srcfiles
	to argument list of a few routines to make that possible. 
      * print_sections.c: moved "line number info" string print so
	it prints for -v as well as normal  line ouput.

2002-10-23   Amaury Le Leyzour amaury@sgi.com
      * print_sections.c (print_weaknames): Changed
        DW_DLA_TYPENAME to DW_DLA_WEAK at dwarf_dealloc().

2002-10-22  Tom Hughes <thh@cyberscience.com>
      * print_sections.c: macro printing now supported.
      * dwarfdump.c: removed erroneous dwarf_dealloc()
        of string returned by dwarf_errmsg().
 
2002-11-22  David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * dwarf_names.awk at_list.awk: Allow an name to have two 
        spellings so the historical name preserved yet the dwarf3 
        version is supported. First name seen is used/reported
        by dwarfdump.
      * dwarf.h:   DW_TAG_template_type_param(eter)
        DW_TAG_template_value_param(eter) DW_AT_namelist_itm(s)   
        are the ones with alternate spellings now.
        Added Universal Parallel C TAGs/Attributes in
	user namespace.
      * tag_attr.c tag_attr.list tag_tree.c tag_tree.list:
        Use the DW_TAG_template_* dwarf3 spellings.


2002-05-08  David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>
      * tag_attr.list dwarf.h: DW_AT_namelist_items is
	wrong, changed to DW_AT_namelist_item

2002-04-29  Stephen Clarke <stephen.clarke@superh.com>
      * dwarfdump.c (main): #ifdef for __CYGWIN__ on open().

2001-06-14  David Anderson <davea@sgi.com>

      * print_sections.c: Calling the new libdwarf function
	dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset() so we can print
	the cu header offset for aranges.


2000-07-14  Fred Fish  <fnf@ninemoons.com>
 
      * configure.in (LOCATION_OF_LIBELFHEADER): Fix typo for configure
      variable to be tested and enclose libelf/libelf.h in <>.
      * configure: Regenerated.
       
2000-07-10  Fred Fish  <fnf@ninemoons.com>
 
      * Makefile.in (install): Install dwarfdump.1 from $(srcdir).

2000 June 12   davea@sgi.com
  print_sections.c the DW_CFA_offset_extended print 
	did not multiply by data-alignment factor in the
	-v -v detailed output.
	And the offsets used %2d when the values were
	unsigned int, so now %2u.

	And not all cfa prints of values had
	necessarily a type to match
	%llu or %lld where required. Depended on the size of Dwarf_Signed
	and Dwarf_Unsigned.
	So now explicitly use cast to the
	right type to match the % format.
2000 April 13 davea@sgi.com
  print_sections.c - 1.56
        - A single byte of zero is a perfectly legitmate null 
          abbreviation entry          (in .debug_abbrev) 
	 now we print those directly and avoid a warning
          from dwarfdump

  print_die.c - 1.42
        - Explain what combo checker is doing and make it 
	  more maintainable (and fix bug which would 
	  not be hit, but was real enough (in combo checker),
	  using too large a number as highest tag number).

  tag_tree.list - 1.2
        - Add valid parent/child relationships so checker 
	  does not report valid entries as bogus.




2000 Feb 24
  Jason Merrill <jason@cygnus.com> noticed that gcc did
  not like   gcc -E foo.list, so  incorporated his fix so
  now the Makefile.in makes a link and does gcc -E _tmp.c

2000 Jan 26
  elena.demikhovsky@intel.com noticed that 3 statements in
  print_sections.c got warnings from the compiler
  she was using. Simple casts  (provided by her) fixed these.

1999 July 21
  davea@sgi.com 
  print_sections changed to allow printing
  of dwarf-ish egcs c++ .eh_frame data


1999 June 14
  Fred Fish fnf@ninemoons.com contributed
  autoconf'ing of the libdwarf and dwarfdump source.
