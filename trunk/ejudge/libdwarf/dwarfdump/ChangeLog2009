2009-06-06: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * naming.c,naming.h: New files that implement the
        ellipsis functionality of dwarfdump and defer to
        libdwarf to get the names of the TAGs, attributes, FORMs, etc.
      * gennames.c: This file has moved to libdwarf, no longer
        present in dwarfdump.
      * esb.h, esb.c: Change certain char* arguments to const char*
        to avoid compiler warnings.

        provides the TAG, ATTR, etc name strings now.
      * dwarfdump.c:  Updated DWARFDUMP_VERSION string.
      * tag_tree.c,tag_attr.c: Include changed from dwarf_names.h to

        Calls to get_TAG_name (etc) no longer have a dbg argument.
      * Makefile.in: We no longer build generated file names.c,
        we build naming.c (hand coded, not generated).
2009-05-07: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.cc: updated DWARF_VERSION string.
      * Makefile.in: dwarf_names* are now generated by C,
        so 'clean' now cleans them out.
2009-05-04: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * common.h, common.c: Extracted simple utility routines
        into their own files. 
      * dwarf_names.awk, at_list.awk: deleted. gennames.c replaces these.
      * tag_common.c, tag_common.h: Removed the simple utility
        routines from these files to simplify dependencies.

        address size used for the CU in question.
      * Makefile.in: Now handles common.* and gennames.c changes.
      * gennames.c: New code emitting string 'get name' source.
        Replaces awk source.
2009-04-04: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: clean up 'clean' and 'distclean'
        so that distributed files are not cleaned out by 'clean'
        and all generated files (even those shipped in
        distribution) are cleaned out by distclean.
      * dwarfdump.c: Now calls the new
        libdwarf function dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value() and other
        such functions to specify all the values libdwarf needs.
      * dwarfdump.conf: Sets the cfa_reg: value to 
        a new higher value (1436) to avoid conflict with largest
        known register count.
      * dwconf.h: Corrected commentary on DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3.
      * dwconf.c: Now uses DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3 as default for
        interface 3, rather than a directly typed number.

        a newline in the generated code.
      * print_locs.c: Add -v section offset output to loclist printing
        of the debug_loc section so the entries can be matched to
        loclist printing initiated from .debug_info.
2009-03-24: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * README: Would be nice if all could use dwarfdump2,
        not this C dwarfdump.
      * dwconf.c: Initialize new frame regs configure data and
        parse it in the .conf file. Fixed old formatting mistakes.
      * dwconf.h: Add new fields to frame regs configure struct. Make -R 
        be 1200 regs so that -R covers all the currently popular ABIs.
      * print_die.c, print_lines.c, print_frames.c: Change %# to
        0x%  so that zero prints with leading 0x consistently.
      * dwarfdump.c: -R is now 1200 registers. So config function 
        changed and usage message needed update.
      * dwarfdump.1: Change -R to 1200 and document -C.
      * dwarfdump.conf: Add same_val_reg:  and undefined_val_reg: 
        initial values where needed or interesting.
      * print_macros.c: Fix old formatting mistake.
2009-03-23: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_sections.h: New file for print_*.c
        sources.
      * dwarfdump.1: Added -C documentation.
      * Makefile.in: updated 'mandir' so it works with
        current configure (so now make install properly installs
        the man page).
      * print_sections.c: Moved get_fde_proc_name() and related
        code to print_frames.c, where it is referenced.
      * dwarfdump.c: No longer turn on info_flag with -f or -F.
        Moved the Usage strings into a string table and loop through
        to print them.
      * globals.h: Removed  get_fde_proc_name() declaration.
      * print_frames.c: Added  get_fde_proc_name() here
        and removed the 'inlined:' from the abstract origin
        name.
2009-03-20: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_static_vars.c, print_static_funcs.c, print_strings.c,
        print_locs.c, print_pubnames.c, print_lines.c, print_ranges.c,
        print_abbrevs.c, print_macros.c, print_types.c, print_weaknames.c,
        print_aranges.c: Moved the print_* functions from print_sections.c
        into individual sourcefiles.
      * Makefile.in: Now lists the new sourcefiles.
      * print_sections.c: Deleted code moved to individual sourcefiles.
        Added code to try to find the name from a DW_AT_abstract_origin 
	DIE when a subprogram DIE itself has no DW_AT_name;
      * dwarfdump.c: Remove unused local variables. Use DWARFDUMP_VERSION
        #define to set version string.
      * tag_tree.c: Fix && || problem with parentheses.
      * tag_attr.c: Fix && || problem with parentheses.
      * print_frames.c: Moved the 'print_frames' function itself from
        print_sections.c to here.
2009-03-17: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * globals.h: Created predicate function
        should_skip_this_cu() predicate function.  Eliminating
        code duplication.
      * print_frames.c: Fix a hex value output to have a leading
        0x as all hex values should (when printed).
      * print_sections.c: Call should_skip_this_cu(), which
        replaces duplicate code.
        Fix the arange print: now the hex value has a leading 0x
        as all hex values should.  get_proc_name() had local
        variable funcnamefound initialized incorrectly, now is
        set to 0 as it should be. get_nested_proc_name()
        now initializes string buffers. get_fde_proc_name()
        now initializes its string buffer.  Surprisingly
        things worked adequately before in spite of the errors.
      * dwarfdump.c: Call should_skip_this_cu(). Implementation
        of that new function is in this source file.
2009-03-16: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_frames.c:DW_CFA_restore output had a spurious newline.
        Removed 2 pointless blank lines an initialized 2 local variables.
      * print_sections.c: Removed a pointless redeclaration of a function
        in libdwarf.h. check_info_offset_sanity() was missing a
        return statement in one place, which could lead to spurious
        extra (and silly) error text.
2009-03-09: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c: Make a comment easier to understand.
2009-02-28: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: add tmp-*.tmp to the 'clean' rule.
2009-02-17: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_sections.c,print_die.c,tag_common.c,print_frames.c: C99
        in-line declarations and // comments are not intended here,
        this removes a few that were introduced accidentally.
2009-02-16: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: Removed some use of awk and
        simplified some shell scripting here.
        renamed temp files, no longer named with
        underbars, they uniformly start with 'tmp-'.
      * print_sections.c: Added the new argument required
        by the updated dwarf_names.c functions argument lists.
      * tag_tree_ext.list: List 'common extensions' 
        of tag->tag relationships.
      * tag_attr_ext.list: List 'common extensions' 
        of tag->attr relationships.
      * print_die.c: New 'common extension' tables used
        for checking tag->tag and tag->attr relationships
        unless turned off with -C.
      * dwarf_names.awk: Removed tabs so generated names.c not so
        spread out. Added argument to the generated functions so
        tag_tree.c, tag_attr.c can use these generated functions nicely.
      * dwarfdump.c: Adding -C option, which exposes
        some 'common extensions' of dwarf uses as DWARF CHECK
        (-ka) warnings.  By default these extensions not reported
        as warnings.  
      * tag_tree.c: Now generates base and extensions tables.
        Code in common with tag_attr.c is in tag_common* files.
      * tag_attr.c: Now generates base and extensions tables.
        Code in common with tag_tree.c is in tag_common* files.
      * tag_common.c, tag_common.h: New files with the common
        data extracted from tag_tree.c and tag_attr.c
      * globals.h: global flag added for -C.
      
2009-02-14: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * configure.in: Define --enable-nonstandardprintf
      * config.h.in: new #undef HAVE_NONSTANDARD_PRINTF_64_FORMAT
      * configure: Regenerated.
      * config.guess, config.sub: Latest version from GNU.
      * Makefile.in: Referenced configure variable to avoid
        irritating message at configure time.
      * README: document --enable-nonstandardprintf
      * print_sections.c, print_die.c, print_reloc.c, dwarfdump.c,
        dwconf.c, print_frames.c: Use libdwarf.h DW_PR_ printf macros
        for for better portability.
2009-02-13: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_sections.c: Ensure we are checking line table header
        correctness whichever line-table-print code is being used.
        Allow ARM line header table (which has a bug) to be used.
      * dwarfdump.c: Print lines_result total with checking on.
      * globals.h: Add lines_result global to count line botches.
2009-02-11: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_sections.c, print_die.c: DWARF_CHECK_ERROR*
        macros now get the count struct passed in.
      * tag_tree.c, tag_attr.c: Add a comment in the output
        identifying the output as generated code and
        with the generation date/time inserted.
      * globals.h: Accept the struct in DWARF_CHECK_ERROR*
        macros so we can update the error count in the macro.
2009-01-31: David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: Remove compilation of _tag_attr_table.c
        and _tag_tree_table.c as those are #included in
        print_die.c, not separately compiled.
      * print_frames.c: A formerly-static function now called
        from another file, so declare it here.
      * print_sections.c: Improve the printing of the .debug_loc
        section.
      * print_die.c: A  couple of errors were missing their error
        count increment.
      * tag_attr.list tag_tree.list: Some normal relationships
        were left out of the tables: fixed now.
