2013-10-17  David Anderson
     * print_types.c: Remove pointless blank line.
2013-08-15  David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Now calls dwarf_register_printf_callback()
       so dwarf_print_lines() output is shown (if dwarfdump
       wants it shown).  Update version string.
      * common.c: Update version string.
2013-08-13  David Anderson
     * esb.c: Add 1 so the esb_append_printf has room for the NUL
       byte.
     * print_die.c: Clarified a comment about DW_AT_high_pc
       and FORM class constant. Fixed indent error.
     * dwarfdump.c: Fixed indent error.
2013-08-08  David Anderson
     * print_reloc.c: Removed duplicated call to get_scndata().
2013-08-07  David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Changed non-fatal error messages to write
       to stdout instead of stderr. Making it much easier to
       have a usable output-with-errors in case of redirection.
       Updated version string.
     * checkutil.c: If a certain pointer not set, just do nothing, 
       there is no reason to abort.  
       Added in a missing [ in a debug printf.
     * common.c: Updated version string.
2013-07-30  David Anderson
     * common.c,dwarfdump.c: updated version string.
2013-02-05  David Anderson
      * dwarfdump.c: Update version string.
        get_producer_name() now uses struct esb_s;
      * common.c: Update version string.
      * print_die.c: Check DW_AT_sibling values for sanity,
        and when something quite wrong is found, print an error
        and stop.
        get_producer_name() now uses struct esb_s;
        Added sibling_die_global_offset_ to die_stack_data_s
        so we can check sibling attribute values.
        get_attr_value() now uses esb_s pointer.
      * globals.h: get_producer_name() now uses struct esb_s;
      * print_aranges.c, print_pubnames.c:get_producer_name() 
        now uses struct esb_s;
      * dwconf.c: The use of esb_s means we need to consider
        an empty config-file-path as no path and look in default
        places.  We cannot just test for null pointer.
2013-02-04  David Anderson
      * dwarfdump/addrmap.c: Forgot to remove the addr_map_destroy()
        implementation in #ifndef HAVE_TSEARCH. Now it is removed.
2013-02-03  David Anderson
      * dwarfdump/addrmap.c: Implement HAVE_TDESTROY. 
        tdestroy() is GNU only. Now we allow tsearch without
        tdestroy even though that means leaking every tsearch
        map we build.  dwarfdump2 has no such leak.
      * dwarfdump/config.h.in: Add HAVE_TDESTROY.
      * dwarfdump/configure: Regenerate.
      * dwarfdump/configure.in: Test for tdestroy() function.
      * dwarfdump/print_frames.c: Zero out the map pointer.
2013-02-01  David Anderson
      * print_die.c: Replaced use of makename (which did malloc)
        with use of struct esb_s, avoiding a serious memory leak.
        Completely removed static struct variables esb_base and
        esb_extra, ensuring die string print-data is not
        corrupted by recursive calls.
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
2013-01-26  David Anderson
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
      * print_die.c: Print DW_OP_GNU_const_type properly using
        the binary-compatibility version of Dwarf_Loc.
2013-01-25  David Anderson
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
      * print_die.c: Print DW_OP_GNU_const_type properly.
2013-01-16  David Anderson
      * dwconf.c: Changed table size to unsigned to eliminate
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * dwconf.h: Changed struct fields to unsigned to eliminate
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * esb.c: Checked for negative vfprintf return to avoid
        (hopefully impossible) error from crashing the program,
        and fix comparison warnings.
      * print_die.c: Changed counts to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * print_frames.c: Changed counts to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * print_reloc.c: Changed table sizes to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * tag_tree.c, tag_attr.c: Changed table sizes to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
2013-01-16  David Anderson
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
