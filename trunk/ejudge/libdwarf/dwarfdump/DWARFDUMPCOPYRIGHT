========The dwarfdump copyright=======

The full text of the GPL version 2 is provided in the file GPL.txt.

Nearly all the files in this directory have contained a GPL
copyright, not an LGPL copyright, for years.  The following
is an example of that copyright as used in the dwarfdump
source, and is what SGI always intended (in David
Anderson's opinion) to have present in
the DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT file.  (tag_tree.list tag_attr.list
acconfig.h have long been marked LGPL and therefore the LGPL
copyright, not GPL, applies to those three files.)  This GPL
copyright text added  here to DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT Dec 4, 2006

The following was the entire content of this file before
December 24 2006, Being the LGPL text this is in conflict
with the individual source files and I (David Anderson)
believe the source file copyright was intended for dwarfdump
not the LGPL source directly following this note.  However the
3 files tag_tree.list tag_attr.list acconfig.h have long been
marked LGPL and the following copyright applies to those three.
