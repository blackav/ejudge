2011-12-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_die.c: Add support for newer DW_OP_GNU_* .
2011-12-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
     * tag_attr_ext.list, tag_common.h: New information on GNU
       attributes meant allowing a larger row count.
2011-12-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * tag_common.h: A new attr in the .list means increasing
       the column count.
2011-12-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_lines.c: Now prints no-column as 0 not -1.
       And prints the DWARF3/4 line table values when present.
     * tag_attr_ext.list: Add a GNU extension.
2011-10-30  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * configure.in: Removed a couple bogus lines which were
       reporting strange shell errors.
     * configure:  Regenerated.
     * dwarfdump.c: Refine the error outputs so bogus reports
       do not print.  Refactor the debuginfo/types prints for
       better reporting of errors.
     * globals.h: Refactoring meant changing one prototype here,
       the print_infos() prototype.
     * print_die.c: Refactor the debuginfo/types prints for
       better reporting of errors.  Remove an 'error' report
       about DW_DLE_REF_SIG8_NOT_HANDLED.  It's unclear
       what we might want to do here in future, but an error
       report is misleading.
2011-10-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version strings.
2011-10-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.c: Reset the CU hints at each new section.
       Set up reloc flags so debug_types gets relocated if necessary.
     * globals.h: Add DEBUG_TYPES for the .debug_types section.
       Add a type-unit signature pretty-printer function.
       Add DW_SECTION_REL_DEBUG_TYPES so debug_types can be relocated.
     * print_reloc.c: Add entries so debug_types can get relocated.
     * print_die.c: Now we handle both debug_info and debug_types
       sections.  Moved some CU header print operations to little
       helper functions to clarify the code. Refactored print_infos()
       to deal with debug_types and debug_info.
       Using the new libdwarf functions that allow debug_types.
     * print_lines.c: Delete unused local variable and its setting code.
2011-10-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Makefile.in, README: Added Make settings of PREINCS POSTINCS
       PRELIBS, POSTLIBS to simplify building when libdwarf or libelf
       are not in the normal locations.   Documented usable ways to
       deal with unusual situations at build time.
2011-10-24  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.c: Update version string.  
     * dwarfdump.c: Update version string.  
       To get '-c cu-name'  to work we need to set a local flag which is now set.
     * dwarfdump.1: Clearly identify the command line options where
       URI style input is expected.
2011-10-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.c: Fix omission of a 'break' statement for case 'q'.
2011-10-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.1: Now command line input strings 
       are translated from uri-style
     * dwarfdump.c: Translate input strings to from uri style to characters.
       Fix indentation mistakes.
       Fix constness issues on character strings.
     * dwconf.c: Fix constness issues on character strings.
     * dwconf.h: Fix constness issues on character strings.
     * globals.h: Fix constness issues on character strings.
     * makename.c: Fix constness issues on character strings.
     * makename.h: Fix constness issues on character strings.
     * uri.c: Fix indentation mistakes.
2011-10-22  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.c :Update version string.
     * dwarfdump.c: Update version string. Do not set ranges_flag
       with -a because that is unsafe to print seperately in general.
     * dwarfdump.1: Rewrite the man page for completeness and
       accuracy.
2011-10-11  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.c: Update version string.
     * dwarfdump.c: Update version string and translate -S strings
       from uri-style to standard strings so spaces and other standard
       characters are easily represented (no quoting problems).
       Update version string.
     * print_die.c: For -S -W we were printing the wrong die-level.
     * uri.h,uri.c: Add the translate_from_uri() function.
       Fix some of the tests in uri.c to match to- and from-uri.
2011-10-09  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * common.c, dwarfdump.c: Update version strings.
2011-10-09  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwconf.c,print_die.c, print_frames.c: Fix bad indentation.
2011-10-09  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_die.c (get_location_list): Tests for DW_DLV_ERROR
       were written without {}, added in the braces.
2011-10-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.cc: If doing any relevant checking,
       instantiate all three possibly-usable BucketGroup objects.
       That makes it simpler to avoid a coredump when the user
       provides a nonsensical option set  --  at a cost of
       a very small amount of memory.
2011-10-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.c: Removed a newline in a printf to match dwarfdump2.
       Calls of get_attr_value() now have extra argument, so
       fix them.
     * dwarfdump.conf: Having 'mips' be an ABI which really reflected
       the IRIX abi and IRIX compilers was a mistake.   Now that 
       abi works for modern MIPS.
     * globals.h: get_attr_value() adds an argument.
     * print_die.c: Expanded the error messages in a couple type_offset_result
       checks.  Worked around the global nature of esb_base by
       saving it locally while we recursively traverse DW_AT_type like things
       looking for bad references. Added a 'verbose' argument a few places
       so (at a critical point) show_form_itself won't add a form
       string when we really don't want it to.
     * print_static_funcs.c:  Fixed an error string so it says
       static funcs, not pubnames.
     * print_lines.c: Ensure we only check for errors when
       we request such checking.
     * print_reloc.c: Ensure we don't index off the end of scn_names.
       Deal with missing names and bad symbol indexes consistently.
       When working with a .rela, report name as the section name
       instead of calling it .rel in the relocations output.
2011-10-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.c: Increased COMPILER_TABLE_MAX for better reporting.
       Provide a 'HARMLESS ERROR' title in output if there are any such.
       One issue is (for relocatable objects) libdwarf attempts to continue
       even if relocations fail, and a relocation failure is now 
       counted as a harmless error (even if it turns out to be harmful!).
       When sorting compilers_detected, use the producer name to sort
       when error counts are identical.  If the compiler table fills up,
       print a note. With -ka, no longer explicitly turn check_frames_extended
       off, it is off already unless the user turned it on explicitly with
       -kxe.
     * print_die.c: The check for a file number (decl_file) was simply wrong.
       Made some detail changes to reporting.
     * print_frames.c: Added comments about the inefficiency for getting
       function names when printing frames (dwarfdump2 does not suffer
       the same inefficiency).
     * print_locs.c: Do not use a side effect for updating the index
       before printing in print_locs().
2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.c: for -kF, add check_lines. Ensure uniformity
       in the usage-text ending.
     * print_lines.c: Ensure lines printing suppresses some
       error reporting when appropriate.
2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_die.c: Fix the formx code by removing recently-added use of llabs().
       Fix format botch, and correct small error string mistakes. Empty
       esb_extra string when it is no longer valid.
2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Minor formatting changes.
      * print_die.c: Initialize some local varables at definition. Ensure that
        we do not get a FORM name in a name string (so a test
        works right).  And also ensure a FORM name does not get
        into a compiler-target setting.  Refine the formx_print_value()
        so it is more complete (like dwarfdump2). Ensure show_form_itself()
        uses the argument, not a global, for the show-form test.
      * naming.c:  Introduce a {} pair on an 'if' 
        to reduce the possibility of future
        errors.
      * print_pubnames.c: Add error details to match dwarfdump2.
      * print_ranges.c: If not printing, return immediately.
      * print_reloc.c: A test was coded with = where == was needed.
      * print_types.c: Move local variable definitions to the
        block they are used in.
2011-09-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Amplifying the -n help string.
      * print_abbrev.c: Adding the standard test of the section
        print option before printing the header line for the abbrevs section.
      * print_die.c: Added a {} pair to avoid eventual bug.
      * print_frames.c: Reformatted a comment for readability.
      * print_lines.c: Added a status test for consistency with the rest
        of the code.
      * print_reloc.c: One of the assign-and-test removal changes
        in the previous changes was wrong.
2011-09-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Removed duplicate usage_text strings.
      * print_reloc.c:  In case we don't have ELF64 headers,
        do the last-best-hope internal define in the right place
        so it actually helps. For some local variables, ensure
        they have values defined at the definition point.
        Switch some assign-and-test into two lines.
2011-09-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: Fixed typo in comment.
      * common.c: Use snprintf, not sprintf. Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.c: Correct typo and move usage_text to
        a source position corresponding to that in dwarfdump.cc.
        Updated version string.
2011-09-16  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
2011-09-15  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
2011-09-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
2011-09-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * config.h, configure.in, dwconf.c, globals.h: Switch 
        compile dependency to configure time HAVE_STDAFX_H
        instead a system-dependent ifdef. 
      * configure: regenerate.
2011-09-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_frames.c: Ensure each tsearch tree pointer is zeroed
        after emptying the tree.
      * addrmap.c: Now we actually free all the records, we were
        misusing tsearch a little bit.
2011-09-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_frames.c: Now only check duplicate fdes if checking
        frames.
      * dwarfdump.conf: Updated to use address_size and includeabi.
      * dwconf.h, dwconf.c: Adding configure keywords address_size
        and includeabi.
2011-09-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * common.c,dwarfdump.c: Update version string.
2011-06-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c,common.c: Updated version string. 
      * dwarfdump.c: Refactor setting of do_print_dwarf 
        and do_check_dwarf into a function. Ensure that one of
        the refactored new functions is called in every case
        an option requires such call. Ensured indents ok.
      * print_lines.c (print_line_numbers_this_cu): When not checking 
        added a check to insure we don't try to call a 
        checking-related function.
2011-06-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * CODINGSTYLE: Added this new document.
      * common.c: Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string, fixed indentation.
      * print_lines.c: Two line table checks moved from
        decl_file to line_table sections of the summary report
        and both now show the possibly-wrong pc.
        Since one is not necessarily a bug, the wording of the
        message now has 'possibly' in it.
      * print_die.c: Reinitialize subprogram-relative pc high/low
        seen_PU_high_address
        whenever compilation unit changes, and use that field
        to avoid an erroneous  comparison (when checking for an error).
        Fix some indentation errors introduced recently.
2011-06-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Changed the missing-producer-attribute
        default string used in summary/error
        outputs to  "<CU-missing-DW_AT_producer>"
        so it is this string clearer.
2011-06-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c: Now we strip off quotes dwarfdump
        added so -S match=main and the like work.
2011-06-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * common.c: Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string.
      * print_die.c: Corrected handling of DW_AT_data_member_location.
        Corrected handling of 'class constant' function
        formxdata_print_value() so it does not leak memory.
2011-06-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string.
        Now -kd forces a summary error report, always.
        Even if no errors found or even checked-for.
      * common.c: Updated version string.
2011-06-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c,print_aranges.c,print_reloc.c: A few indents
        did not match the standard multiple-of-4-spaces. Corrected.
2011-06-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * checkutil.c (ProcessBucketGroup): Deleted unused
        local variables.
      * common.c: Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.1: Made the -k discussion more complete and accurate.
        Most option details are in the dwarfdump help/usage message, not
        in dwarfdump.1, to keep the man page small.
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string. Made more variables static
        in recognition they are only touched in this file.  Added {} on
        some if statements to make the body clear. Parenthesized a
        complex test with && || to clarify intent.  Added sanity testing
        of the 'current compiler' count and its use.
      * globals.h: Added safe_strcpy() prototype as it is used by multiple
        source files so we need a visible prototype.
      * print_aranges.c: Add 'arange end' printing (it is a real DWARF
        record type, so should be printed). Add a test to avoid duplicated
        die printing and error-counting when it is not requested.
      * print_die.c: An = in an if corrected to ==.  Parenthesized a
        complex test with && || to clarify intent.  Deleted an unused
        local variable.
      * print_lines.c: Deleted unused local variables. Added {} for each
        struct in an array so the initialization gets done right.
      * tag_attr.c: Deleted an unused local variable.
      * tag_tree.c: Deleted an unused local variable.
2011-04-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Updated DWARF_VERSION string.
2011-01-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_frames.h print_static_vars.c Makefile.in
        print_static_funcs.c print_sections.c print_strings.c print_locs.c
        print_die.c print_reloc.c print_reloc.h print_lines.c print_pubnames.c
        dwarfdump.c strstrnocase.c tag_tree.c print_ranges.c print_abbrevs.c
        print_macros.c configure.in tag_attr.c dwarfdump.1 naming.c
        esb.c checkutil.c makename.c dwconf.c print_types.c checkutil.h
        tag_tree.list print_weaknames.c globals.h common.c print_frames.c
        print_aranges.c common.h:  New correctness tests and new
        formatting of various reports.
