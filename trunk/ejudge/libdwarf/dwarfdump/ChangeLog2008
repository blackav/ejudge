      * tag_attr.list: Mark DW_AT_artificial as sensible on
        DW_TAG_variable.
      * dwarfdump.1: Document -N option to print .debug_ranges.
      * Makefile.in: add new source header files
      * dwarfdump.c: Implement -N to print .debug_ranges.
      * print_sections.c: Allow more flexible printing
        of function names for .debug_frame section.
	With -N, print .debug_ranges.
      * print_die.c: Print .debug_ranges details.
      * print_frames.c: Delete useless comment.
      * globals.h: Allow re-use of debug_ranges formatting code.
      * Makefile.in: Make the header dependency list more complete.
      * makename.h: Comment tweaked.
2008-12-08 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c: the -M option now also prints the form
        number (after the form name).  And -v prints the DIE
        abbreviation code, the index into the relevant abbreviation
        table.
      * globals.h: Removed unused global variable.
      * dwarfdump.c: Removed unused global variable.
      * dwarfdump.1: document -M and the new -v features.
2008-12-07 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_reloc.c (print_relocinfo): Removed unused local variable.
2008-11-19 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * globals.h: Added new boolean to support -M.
      * dwarfdump.1: Mentioning the -M option.
      * dwarfdump.c: Implementing -M, which has each attribute line
        show the name of the form.
      * print_die.c: Implementing -M option.
2008-10-12 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.conf: Adding power pc register names and table
        size for use with -x abi=ppc  .
2008-08-13 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.1: When no options (just object files) present
        all sections print, now we say that.  Renamed fields
        in synopsis for readability.
2008-06-23 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_reloc.c (print_reloc_information_64): Was testing
        sym_data_entry_count one place where sym_data_64_entry_count
        should have been tested. Thanks to Carlos Alberto Enciso
        for noticing.
2008-06-17 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c: Add to dwarf_formstring failure message.
      * README: Correct email: the old sgi.com address is no
        longer correct.
2008-06-13 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwconf.c: Fix an off-by-one condition where
        we could index off the end of the cf_regs array in printing
        a register name.
2008-04-12 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_reloc.c:  Verify stringtab exists and is
        large enough before indexing into it to get a string
        in printing relocations.
        (Providing default name "<no name>" so it's evident from
        the output that we used a default name string).
2008-04-09 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_sections.c (get_fde_proc_name): Initialize some
        local variables at declaration.  The function is very slow
        and needs a replacement.
      * print_die.c:  Fixes a typo in a comment.
      * dwarfdump.c: Added -n option to suppress function name search
        when printing FDEs. Current dwarfdump is n-squared at least
        getting those names, this is a bandage-type-workaround when
        there are so many FDEs the slowness is painful.
      * globals.h: Support for -n option.
      * print_frames.c: Support for -n option.
2008-04-08 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Added -H option for testing
        (it limits the run length).
        And the support for -H in printing DIEs.
      * globals.h: Added extern for -H option declaration.
      * print_sections.c: Added -H option support to limit frames printing.

2008-04-04 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c (tag_tree_combination, tag_attr_combination):
        Ensure we do not index off the end of the -k checking arrays.
      * print_sections.c: Increase the size of a local variable,.
2008-03-03 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.1: Add description of -ka option.
      * print_frames.h print_sections.c testesb.c print_die.c print_reloc.c
        dwarfdump.c tag_tree.c tag_attr.c esb.c esb.h makename.c dwconf.c
        makename.h dwconf.h globals.h print_frames.c: Change tabs
        to spaces with expand(1).
2008-03-03 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c: Now check that DW_AT_decl_file
        and DW_AT_call_file indexes are valid and count instances of the
        attribute and errors found in it.
      * dwarfdump.c: With -ka and -ky now check that DW_AT_decl_file
        and DW_AT_call_file indexes are valid and warn if bad.
        Thanks to Carlos Alberto Enciso for the suggestion.
      * globals.h: Declare new fields for the  DW_AT_decl_file
        DW_AT_call_file checks. 
2008-02-26 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c (get_attr_value): Print DW_AT_call_file,
        DW_AT_call_line, DW_AT_call_column nicely.
