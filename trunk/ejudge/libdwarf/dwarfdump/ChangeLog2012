     * addrmap.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
     * checkutil.c: Incorrect string prefix for .text 
       linkonce section name,
       is '.text.' for the applicable linke once sections, not 
       simply '.text'
       Added print of internal (debugging dwarfdump) data not
       previously printed.
     * common.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
       Include "config.h".
       Minor layout change for #ifdef _DEBUG.
       Add HAVE_STDAFX_H check.
     * dwarfdump.1: Changes for new options: -E*, -h, -ls, -kE, plus
       some minor typo corrections.
     * dwarfdump.c: Consistent layout for if, for statements.
       Expand -E option to print the full information for 
       the ELF header
       (32-bit and 64-bit) to include additional fields (e_ehsize,
       e_phentsize, e_phnum, e_shentsize, e_shnum, e_shstrndx). Also,
       depending on the additional option to -E, the index, address,
       size and name for sections is printed. The additional option
       follow the convention used for -o option and can include any of
       the letters: hliaprfoRstxd.
       -Eh print information for the ELF header
       -E{liaprfoRs} print information for debug related sections
       -Ex print information for .text section
       -Ed same as -E{liaprfoRstx}.
       -E print the ELF header and the info for all available sections.
       New option: -kE, the attribute encodings are checked
       to see if they can use fewer bytes when encoded using LEB128.
       Expand -l option to print line information with no offsets
       values (-ls). Useful for comparisons.
       Expand -S option to print number of occurrences for the
       searched pattern (-Sv<search_options>.
       Remove support for internally quoted strings.
       Remove extra 'break' for case 'o' in 'process_args'.
       Include the value zero for -# (internal debug level)
       Fix layout for 'qsort_compare_compiler' and use compiler
       name in the sort to get a stable sort.
       Now that name strings are not qoted internally,
       ensure that we do not expect such quotes in checking
       compiler names.
     * dwconf.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
     * globals.h: Add externs and defines for the items
       newly needed globally.
     * naming.c: Consistent layout for if, for statements.
     * print_aranges.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
     * print_die.c: Consistent layout for if, for and switch statements.
       Remove unused symbols 'seen_PU_base_address', 
       'seen_PU_high_address'.  Rename 'errno' to 
       'dwerrno' to avoid conflict with system symbol.
       Missing DWARF_CHECK_COUNT and DWARF_CHECK_ERROR 
       when testing self references category.
       Support for counting number of occurrences of the pattern being
       searched (See -S option).
       Add support for new option -kE; the atrribute 
       encodings are checked to see if they can use 
       fewer bytes when encoded using LEB128. New
       functions 'check_attributes_encoding', 
       'print_attributes_encoding'
       and new data structure 'a_attr_encoding' were created.
       Include DW_TAG_template_alias in the function 
       'get_attr_value' as it
       refers to a type in the case of checks for type offsets.
       Remove support for internally quoted strings.
       Add space so DW_OP_bregx prints more readably.
     * print_frames.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
     * print_lines.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
       Implement the ability to print line information 
       with no offset values (useful when comparisons are 
       required, as the pc values can change
       but the basic line information remains the same). 
       Minor layout changes.
     * print_locs.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
     * print_ranges.c: Consistent layout for if and for statements.
     * print_reloc.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
       Move names for relocation types to individual 
       header files based on architecture (ARM, MIPS, PPC, 
       PPC64, X86_64).
       Fix incorrect layout for 'set_relocation_table_names' function.
       Use condition compilation symbols (DWARF_RELOC_MIPS, 
       DWARF_RELOC_PPC, DWARF_RELOC_PPC64, DWARF_RELOC_ARM, 
       DWARF_RELOC_X86_64)in the function 
       'set_relocation_table_names' to get relocation 
       table information.  
       Add support for X86_64 architecture.
     * print_reloc.h: Move definitions for relocation types 
       to individual header files based on architecture 
       (ARM, MIPS, PPC, PPC64, X86_64). 
     * print_strings.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
     * strstrnocase.c: Consistent layout for if and for statements.
     * tag_attr.c: Consistent layout for if and for statements.
     * tag_attr.list: Add some missing attributes and 
       the complete set for DW_TAG_rvalue_reference_type; 
       remove a duplicated DW_AT_name.
     * tag_common.c: Consistent layout for if statements.
     * tag_tree.c: Consistent layout for if and for statements.
     * tag_tree.list: Missing DW_TAG_union_type to allow 
       verification of nested unions.
     * uri.c: Consistent layout for if and for statements.

     * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Updated version string.
