   * simplereader.c: Now prints all TAGs regardless of
     whether a DIE has a DW_AT_name attribute.  All names
     print an "" pair so it's easy to recognize empty names
     and names with embedded spaces.
March 31, 2010 David Anderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
   * simplereader.c: Added a new option --names which
     shows additional detail on getting attributes and source 
     file information.
