      * Makefile: Some compilers (FreeBSD gcc, for example) do
        not support -gdwarf-4, so changed the compile 
        to -g.

      * Add the --check option to verify that dwarf_highpc()
        and the new dwarf_highpc_b() work properly with
        both form address and form constant instances of
        attributes DW_AT_high_pc.
