The dwarfgen application is intended as both a vehicle
for testing dwarf-generation by libdwarf and as an example
of how one uses libdwarf to generate DWARF.
In addition, it should be useful as a test vehicle for
evaluating future changes to the DWARF standard.

It is necessary as a test-vehicle so that the libdwarf
producer code can be updated to allow more recent features
of DWARF to be supported while trying to guarantee current
producer code users are correctly supported.

By default dwarfgen produces a fake a.out. By that we mean
that no relocation sections are written.  Instead, relocations
are processed directly by dwarfgen.
Perhaps at some point a more a.out-like output will be optionally
supported.
