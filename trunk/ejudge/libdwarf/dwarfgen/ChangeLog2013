     * createirepformfrombinary.cc: Adding 
       support for some CLASS REFERENCE forms.
     * createirepformfrombinary.cc, creatirepfrombinary.cc: Adding 
       support for some CLASS REFERENCE forms.
       Fixed dealloc for dwarf_get_pubtypes to avoid duplicate free.
     * dwarfgen.cc: Added #include so it compiles.
     * irepattrtodbg.cc,irepattrtodbg.h: Added support for 
       some CLASS REFERENCE forms.
     * irepdie.h,irepform.h: Added support for some CLASS REFERENCE forms.
     * irepframe.h: Added 3 comment lines about fde_instrs_
     * ireptodbg.cc: Added support for some CLASS REFERENCE forms.

     * ireppubnames.h: deals with debug_pubnames and debug_pubtypes
       data.
     * irepdie.h: Remember the producer DIE offset so we
       can access it for pubnames/pubtypes.
     * createirepfrombinary.cc: Read in pubnames and pubtypes data.
     * irepresentation.h: Add in pubnames and pubtypes data.
     * ireptodbg.cc: Write out applicable pubnames/pubtype data.

     * dwarfgen.cc: The declaration of CallbackFunc()
       now has const char *name to match the corrected
       declaration in libdwarf.h

     * createirepformfrombinary.cc: IRFormReference now
       allows DW_FORM_data4/8 as reference forms (applies
       to DWARF2). Made two error outputs look just enough
       different to tell which test cause the error string.
     * dwarfgen.cc: Added the -h option to specify transformation
       of DW_AT_high_pc from form address to form const to create
       a specific  regression test case .
     * general.h: Added the -h global flag variable transformHighpcToConst
       as an extern.
     * irepattrtodbg.cc: Now emits class constant attributes and values.
     * irepform.h: Now has a new IRFormConstant constructor so we can
       easily create an attribute on-the-fly internally.
       Added accessor functions for IRFormConstant values.
     * ireptodbg.cc: specialAttrTransformations() does the transformation
       that -h requests: making DW_AT_high_pc be of form constant instead
       of form address.

     * createirepfrombinary.cc,createirepfrombinary.h,dwarfgen.cc,
       general.h,irepattrtodbg.cc,irepattrtodbg.h,irepdie.h,
       irepform.h,irepframe.h,irepline.h,irepmacro.h,irepresentation.h,
       ireptodbg.cc,strtabdata.h: updated copyright year to 2013.
     * createirepformfrombinary.cc: Added missing implemenation
       detals for all FORMs and FormFlag.
     * createirepfrombinary.cc: Rename some local variables
       for readability
       based on the realization that dwarf_whatform and
       dwarf_whatform_direct() are misnamed.
     * irepattrtodbg.cc: Fixed  instances of << cerr when
       << endl was what was wanted.
     * ireptodbg.cc: Fixed cast from pointer to int as int
       is too small, causes build to error off.
     * irepdie.h,irepform.h: Rename form fields 
       from indirectform_ directform_
       to   initialform_ and finalform_ based on the realization
       that dwarf_whatform and dwarf_whatform were misnamed.
