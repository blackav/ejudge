libchecker.a
------------

If NEED_TGZ checker flag is on, a checker has access to `dir_in_path'
and `dir_out_path' variables, which contain the path to input directory
(in the tests source directory) and to the working directory of program
being tested respectively. I.e., to open the input directory the
checker should use `opendir(dir_in_path)' function call. To open the
output directory of the program, the checker should use
`opendir(dir_out_path)' function call.

New functions are added to the library:
  checker_read_corr_double,
  checker_read_corr_long_long,
  checker_read_int,
  checker_read_in_long_double,
  checker_read_long_double,
  checker_read_long_long.
