Minor bugs
==========

None known.

Minor enhancements
==================

o Passing of the run packets via the super-serve proxy, if the contest
  works in managed mode. This means, that if the `serve' program
  started by the `super-serve', it could be reasonable to pass the
  run packet to the `super-serve' program, and it will route them
  to the appropriate instance of the `run' program, starting it,
  if necessary. This will reduce the number of directories watched
  by the `super-serve' program to a single directory instead of
  one directory for each managed contest.
  Difficulty: medium. It may require changing of the run packet format.
o Daemonized mode for `super-serve' and `compile' programs.
  Difficulty: medium. It may require changing of the log format of
  the utilities.
o Log analyzing utilities for the log files of the abovementioned
  tools.
o Implement full support for conditional compilation.
o Remove limitation on 127 tests in the runlog database.
  Difficulty: medium. May require changing of the runlog data format.
  Compatibility problems may appear.

Major enhancements
==================

o Database backend. Support for storing the various data in the
  database (MySQL, Postgress).
  Difficulty: difficult. The data access layer (runlog,
  userlist-server, clarlog) should be rewritten.
o Port to the Win32 platform. The `run' and `compile' utilities
  should be ported first to enable mixed judging environment.
o Personal tester to allow preparing problems and simulating
  their execution under ejudge.
o Split the `run' program into `run-program' and `run-checker'
  to separate program invocation and the result testing.
  Basically, all infrastructure are in place (XML testing
  protocol, full output archive).
