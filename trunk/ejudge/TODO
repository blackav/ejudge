Minor enhancements
==================

o Passing of the run packets via the super-serve proxy, if the contest
  works in managed mode. This means, that if the `serve' program
  started by the `super-serve', it could be reasonable to pass the
  run packet to the `super-serve' program, and it will route them
  to the appropriate instance of the `run' program, starting it,
  if necessary. This will reduce the number of directories watched
  by the `super-serve' program to a single directory instead of
  one directory for each managed contest.
  Difficulty: medium. It may require changing of the run packet format.
o Daemonized mode for `super-serve' and `compile' programs.
  Difficulty: medium. It may require changing of the log format of
  the utilities.
o E-mail alert service. Severe errors should be reported to the
  administrator email. Should be supported by `userlist-server',
  `super-serve', `compile' programs.
  Difficulty: medium.
o Log analyzing utilities for the log files of the abovementioned
  tools.
o The `team' utility should report the current total score/the number
  of the solved problems.

Major enhancements
==================

o Contest configuration wizard. Web based or console tool for
  menu-driven creation of new contests.
  Difficulty: difficult.
o Database backend. Support for storing the various data in the
  database (MySQL, Postgress).
  Difficulty: difficult. The data access layer (runlog,
  userlist-server, clarlog) should be rewritten.
