ejudge upgrade notes
====================

The following abbreviations are used:
CONF_DIR	the directory specified with the `--enable-conf-dir'
		configure's option during initial configuration step
		(the default value is /home/judges/data).
PREFIX		the installation prefix directory, as specified by
		the --prefix configure's option.
BIN_DIR		the directory with the ejudge executable files
		(the default value is PREFIX/bin).
CGI_BIN_DIR	the directory with CGI programs of the http-server
		(for example, /var/www/cgi-bin, but depends on the
		linux distribution used and apache settings).
HTDOCS_DIR	the root directory of the HTML documents of the
		web-server (for example, /var/www/htdocs, but depends
		on the linux distribution used and apache settings).

Migration to version 2.3.2
--------------------------
To upgrade to the ejudge 2.3.2 from the earlier versions preserving
all the settings and contest data, the following steps should be
performed:

1. Add the following text to the CONF_DIR/ejudge.xml
configuration file:
---
  <plugins>
    <plugin type="nsdb" name="files">
       <config>
         <data_dir>CONF_DIR/new-serve-db</data_dir>
       </config>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
---
The text may be inserted after the closing </caps> tag but
before the closing </config> tag.

2. Create the files for the `new-server' program:
BIN_DIR/new-server --create
The `new-server' program should be started under the same user,
as the user used to run the ejudge system.

3. CGI programs are now installed to the
PREFIX/libexec/ejudge/cgi-bin directory rather than to
PREFIX/cgi-bin. Thus, the PREFIX/cgi-bin directory may be removed:
rm -rf PREFIX/cgi-bin
The symbolic links from the CGI_BIN_DIR directory should be
redirected to the new location:
cd CGI_BIN_DIR; ln -sf PREFIX/libexec/ejudge/cgi-bin/* .
`root' permissions may be required to do that

4. Directory `ejudge' should be created in the HTDOCS_DIR
directory. In the `ejudge' directory symlinks should be created
to the HTML style files located in the PREFIX/share/ejudge/style
directory.
cd HTDOCS_DIR; mkdir ejudge; cd ejudge; ln -sf PREFIX/share/ejudge/style/* . 
`root' permissions may be required to do that

The new version is fully backward compatible with the previous
versions, but the `serve' contest server and the `team',
`master' and `judge' CGI programs are rendered obsolete.
`new-server' is recommented for use instead of `serve' and
`new-client', `new-judge', `new-master' CGI programs are
recommented for use intead of the old CGI programs.
To migrate to the new contest server `new-server' from the old
`serve', the XML contest configuration file CONTEST.xml (for
example, 000001.xml, which are normally located in
CONF_DIR/contests) should be changed: the attribute
`managed="yes"' of the <contest> element should be replaced with
the attribute `new_managed="yes"'.

The `team' CGI program automatically redirects users to the
`new-client' CGI program, if the contest is managed by the
`new-server'. Note, however, that the privileged programs
`master' and `judge' does not redirect users. Anyway, after
upgrading, you might want to update hyperlinks in your web
pages, that refer to the ejudge's CGI programs.

To support AJAX on the client side the DoJo Toolkit
(http://dojotoolkit.org) should be installed to the
HTDOCS_DIR/ejudge directory (i.e. the same directory where the
ejudge HTML style files are located). `dojo.js',
`iframe_history.html' files and the `src' directory should be
copied there from the dojo distribution.
